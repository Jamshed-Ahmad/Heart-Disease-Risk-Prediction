# Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction –  A Machine Learning Approach

## 🔍 Project Overview <br>
💡 Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict heart disease risk based on patient health metrics.
📊 Dataset: Real-world medical data containing features like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle indicators.
🛠 Approach: EDA, feature selection, model training, and evaluation with multiple ML algorithms.
🏆 Best Accuracy Achieved: 85%
🚀 Can machine learning help detect heart disease early? This project dives into predictive analytics, using real-world clinical data to assess heart disease risk. By leveraging data science, feature engineering, and model optimization, we aim to identify key health risk factors and build an accurate, explainable prediction model.


## 📌 Key Features & Methodology<br>
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding trends, patterns, and distributions 📊 <br>
✅ Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data 🛠 <br>
✅ Feature Selection – Choosing relevant features for optimal model performance 🏗 <br>
✅ Model Comparison – Evaluating Linear Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree 🔄 <br>
✅ Best Model Selection – Support Vector Machine performed the best with the highest accuracy 85% 🎯 <br>
✅ Dynamic Feature Input – No predefined lists; values are picked directly from the dataset 🏷 <br>
✅ Gradio-Based Web Interface – User-friendly web app for real-time price prediction 💻 <br>

## 📂 Dataset & Features <br>
The dataset contains various attributes affecting house prices, including: <br>
| Feature Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------| 
Location | The area where the house is situated 🏙 <br>
BHK | Number of Bedrooms, Hall, Kitchen 🛏 <br>
Size(Sq.Ft.) | Total area of the house 📐 <br>
Bathroom | Number of bathrooms 🚿 <br>
Price | Target variable – House price in ₹ 💰 <br>

## 📊 Model Performance & Accuracy <br>
| Model | Accuracy (R² Score) |
|-------|---------------------|
Linear Regression | 67.5% <br>
Decision Tree | 78.3% <br>
Random Forest | 89.6% ✅ (Best Model) 

🔹 Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest accuracy (89.6%), making it the optimal choice for predictions. <br>

## 🚀 How to Run the Project <br>
### 1️⃣ Running the Jupyter Notebook
1. Open `Mumbai_Housing_price_project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells to:
   - Perform data preprocessing and EDA.
   - Train and evaluate different regression models.
   - Compare accuracy metrics.

 ### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies 
 pip install `-r requirements.txt`. 

### 3️⃣ Run the Gradio App 
`python app.py`. <br>
or, if using Jupyter Notebook: <br>
`!gradio app.py`. 

The Gradio interface will launch in your browser, allowing you to predict house prices dynamically. 

###🌟 Future Enhancements
🔹 Improve accuracy with advanced ensemble models 🏆.
🔹 Integrate real-time market trends 📈.
🔹 Deploy as a full-fledged web application 🌐.
