Heart Disease Prediction Project
Description: Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient data. Applied classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree.
Key Skills: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Data Preprocessing, EDA, Machine Learning Models.
Highlights:

Performed exploratory data analysis to identify key trends and correlations in patient health metrics.
Implemented and compared multiple classification models to determine the best-performing algorithm.
Achieved a model accuracy of X% using [best algorithm], optimizing hyperparameters with GridSearchCV.
Visualized results and insights with Seaborn for better interpretability.
